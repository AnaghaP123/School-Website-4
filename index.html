    <h4>New School Canteen</h4>

    <p class="list-group-item col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Our school also has a canteen. The canteen is very big and could accommodate many students at a time. We have a coupon system, where the students who would like to have food from the canteen, would require buying coupon for the desired item from the counter during the first short recess of the day in school.

      Then, during the lunch hour, the students assemble in the canteen and they provide their coupons. Based on the coupons, the students would be given the food that they have placed their orders for. The students needs to sit in the canteen and have the food and return back the plates. The canteen at our school would almost be full on all days. Many students come there to have their food.</p>

    <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>
    <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
    <p class="list-group-item col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Simplifies the Attendance Tracking Process
      There are so many options for tracking attendance—and while pen and paper is still a favorite for many educators, it can be unreliable without pre-printed rosters and barcodes for scanning. With the help of technology, you can improve and streamline the attendance-taking process and reducing errors. Technology provides a mobile-friendly way to take attendance on the fly—no matter what (or where) the activity is. For example, this type of solution would allow you to capture attendance while you’re off-site for an activity without having to worry about lugging around paperwork.
      <br>
      2. Helps Support Reporting and Evaluation
      Whether it’s in your 21APR or updates to stakeholders, your program’s funding is likely dependent on accurate attendance data—so why chance it by tracking attendance the manual way? With a student attendance tracking system, you can easily collect and report on participation data when you’re reporting to your existing funding sources or applying for new sources of funding. This helps save a significant amount of time that would otherwise be spent compiling and re-entering/keying data and double-checking for potential errors.
      <br>
      3. Reduces Attendance Data Errors
      Human error is an inevitability—and that’s a clear no-go when you’re working on an attendance report to apply for grant funding. Student attendance tracking technology is changing the game, helping school administrators reduce errors in participation data and giving them peace of mind that everything is accurate in the 21APR.
      <br>
      4. Assists with Meeting Attendance Goals
      With built-in attendance reports, you can easily spot problem areas and identify where there’s room for improvement. For instance, if you recognize that certain students or activities have low participation rates, you can determine what the potential problems are and how you can improve. This ultimately helps you meet attendance goals, including those necessary to comply with regulations at the state and federal level, such as in the mandatory 21APR.</p>
